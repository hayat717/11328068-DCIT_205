## How to clone and set up the project:

From the repository, select the Clone button.
Copy the clone command (either the SSH format or the HTTPS).
If you are using the SSH protocol, ensure your public key is in Bitbucket and loaded on the local system to which you are cloning.
From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.
Paste the command you copied from Bitbucket, for example:

# Clone over HTTPS

$ git clone https://https://github.com/hayat717/11328068-DCIT_205.git
Git Credential Manager users â€” A new window will open and ask you to log into bitbucket.org and authorize the connection.

# Clone over SSH

$ git clone https://https://github.com/hayat717/11328068-DCIT_205.git
If the clone was successful, a new sub-directory appears on your local drive in the directory where you cloned your repository. This directory has the same name as the Bitbucket repository that you cloned. The clone contains the files and metadata that Git requires to maintain the changes you make to the source files.
